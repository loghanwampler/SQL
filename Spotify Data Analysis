-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB0.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data and answered some questions using the following SQL. 

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) desc
LIMIT 10;

--What artist released the longest song? What song is it, and how long is it?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

--What are the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 92;

--Which song has the lowest energy level?
SELECT track_name, energy
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy asc
LIMIT 1;

--Which songs have a tempo that above average for this list?
SELECT track_name, tempo
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE tempo > (SELECT AVG(tempo) FROM Spotifydata)
ORDER BY tempo desc;

--Who are the top 3 artists based on how many songs they have on this 'Top 50' list?
SELECT artist_name, count(*) AS song_quantity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY song_quantity desc
LIMIT 3;

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_avg_CTE AS(
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name,
average_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_avg_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;
